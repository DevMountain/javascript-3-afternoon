  Use the map method on the prices array to calculate a new array of post-tax prices.

  Math reminder! To calculate the price after tax, multiply the price by 1 plus the taxRate as a decimal.
  Example: if tax is 7%, the price afterTax could be calculated like this: afterTax = price * 1.07) 

  The map function also takes a callback with the parameters

  Let's work with some employees at a company.
  You work for Widget Co. They have hundreds of employees.
*/

////////// PROBLEM 1 //////////

/*
  Make a class to help us build all of the employees.
  Each employee has the following properties:
    - first_name
    - last_name
    - email
    - age
  Each employee has the following methods:
    - makeWidget
      - This returns a string equal to the employees first name + last name + the word widget
      - Example: "Dave Smith Widget"

  Call your class Employee and receive all the data in the constructor in the order listed above.
*/

//Code Here



////////// PROBLEM 2 //////////

/*
  Next, make a manager for Widget Co.
  The manager has all the same properties as an Employee.
  Each manager has the following additional properties:
    - reports (other employees) that defaults to an empty array
  Each manager has the following additional methods:
    - hire (employee)
      - Accepts a new employee as a parameter and pushes it to their list of reports.
    - fire (index)
      - Fire removes employees from their list of reports at the given index

  Call your new class Manager
*/

////////// PROBLEM 3 //////////

/*
  Managers for Widget Co. get promoted when they get more employees, and get a bonus when they fire employees.
  Progressive Managers have all the same properties as the manager,
  but they also have the following additional properties:
    - title - default 'Not a manager'
    - bonus - default 0

  When employees are added or removed we need to check and update their title. Their titles are as follows:
    0 : Not a manager
    1-3 : Barely Manager
    4-10 : Mostly Manager
    11-50 : Manager
    51-100 : Manager Plus
    101+ : Bestest Manager

  Everytime they fire an employee they get $100 added to their bonus.

  Call your new class ProgressiveManager

////////// PROBLEM 4 - Black Diamond //////////

/*
  Widget Co has a factory that makes widgets.
  Factories have Machines.

  Make a Machine class that takes in no parameters
  A Machine has the following properties:
    - widgets_made_count - default 0
    - wear_and_tear_count - default 0
    - needs_reboot - default false

  A Machine has the following methods:
    - makeWidgets
        - This function takes in a number and increases widgets_made_count by that amount
        - It also increases wear_and_tear_count by 1 for every 50
    - fixMachine
        - This function sets needs_reboot to true
    - reboot
        - This function returns a function that is called when the machine is done rebooting
        - It should set decrease wear_and_tear_count by 10, and set needs_reboot to false

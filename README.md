# Project Summary

In this project, we'll provide a variety of JavaScript problems to help improve your skills. We would like you to push yourselves as much as possible. We expect you to at least finish two problems in each section. 

If you would like to push yourself further, try to complete every problem. Otherwise, feel free to move on to other content.

## Setup

* `Fork` this repository.
* `Clone` your fork.
* Open `./index.html` with your browser.

`./index.html` will provide links to all the spec runners for your convenience. It also has all the JavaSript files you will be working in imported into it. This will allow you to use the browser debugger for all your code in one spot.

## Tips and Tricks

One of the biggest tools at the developer's disposal is the browser's built-in debugger. To use it, open `./index.html` with your browser. Another great tool for small and isolated pieces of code is <a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#">Pyton Tutor</a>. Just make sure to change the code to `JavaScript ES6`.

## Contributions

If you see a problem or a typo, please fork, make the necessary changes, and create a pull request so we can review your changes and merge them into the master repo and branch.
